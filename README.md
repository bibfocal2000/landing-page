# Step 1

Create Github repo and clone

Download the reference material

Create directory tree on local machine

The project calls for the font to be Roboto. Instead of linking
the url in the head, I am choosing to use the font locally and
adding to the css with @font-face.

# Decisions, decisions, decisions

What type of of company will be reflected in this website?

# Decision accomplished

Musical instrument teaching school

Create a favicon which will also be used as the header logo

Download the Hero image(s) and the four information images that go
with the theme of the company website.
