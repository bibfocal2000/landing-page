This is the second Odin Project within Foundations

I took a lot of liberties with this project and did not follow the program precisely as it was laid out. After going down the rabbit hole of CSS, I discovered many things to experiment with. By using @keyframes I was able to turn the hero image into a scrolling slidshow. This also required(?) that a pseudo class like ::before in combo with z-index be used so that the scrolling occured behind a div with overflow:hidden set. This effect could probably be done better with JavaScript, but this project is just for CSS only, so not using it yet.

As I comb thru the CSS, I keep finding more ways to refactor it, I am leaving it as-is for now. I think that I may have made more divs than needed and added to many more lines of code that are not neccessary. Hoping practice will reduce code length.

The project was fun. Looking forward to the next challanges :)

Fonts
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto

# Step 1

Create Github repo and clone

Download the reference material

Create directory tree on local machine

The project calls for the font to be Roboto. Instead of linking
the url in the head, I am choosing to use the font locally and
adding to the css with @font-face.

# Decisions, decisions, decisions

What type of of company will be reflected in this website?

# Decision accomplished

Musical instrument teaching school

Create a favicon which will also be used as the header logo

Download the Hero image(s) and the four information images that go
with the theme of the company website.

# Git Commits

I did not commit as much as I should have. This really needs to be improved.

README documentation sucks due to my lack of committing enough.
